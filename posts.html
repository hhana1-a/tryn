<h1>SQL</h1>


<h2>First Normal Form (1NF):</h2>

<p>Every piece of information in a table needs to be as simple as possible. So, no tables inside tables, and each column should hold only one kind of data.</p>
<h2>Second Normal Form (2NF):</h2>

<p>Make sure all the information in your table is directly related to the main point of the table, which is usually the primary key. If you have a table with a bunch of stuff in it, make sure each thing is only related to the whole table, not just part of it.</p>
<h2>Third Normal Form (3NF):</h2>

<p>Make sure that all the information in your table is only talking about the primary key, not other non-primary key columns. And make sure none of the non-primary key columns are related to each other. Everything should be connected directly to the main point of the table, which is usually the primary key.</p>
