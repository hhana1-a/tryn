<h1>SQL</h1>


<h2>First Normal Form (1NF):</h2>

<p>Every piece of information in a table needs to be as simple as possible. So, </em>no tables inside tables</em>, and </em>each column should hold only one kind of data.</em></p>
<h2>Second Normal Form (2NF):</h2>

<p>Make sure all the information in your table is <em> directly related to the main point of the table,</em> which is <em>usually the primary key</em>. If you have a table with a bunch of stuff in it, </em>make sure each thing is only related to the whole table, not just part of it.</em></p>
<h2>Third Normal Form (3NF):</h2>

<p>Make sure that all the information in your table is only talking about the primary key, not other non-primary key columns. And </em>make sure none of the non-primary key columns are related to each other.</em> Everything should be connected directly to the main point of the table, which is usually the primary key.</p>
